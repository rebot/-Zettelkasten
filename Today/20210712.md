# Vandaag 2021-07-12

## Obsidian.md
#obsidian/plugin #zettelkasten 
Today I'm learning about two new plugins I'll be using in the future, [Templater]  and [Dataview]. Both are very powerfull. First of all, I'm no longer relying on the build in **template system** of Obsidian.md. [Templater] comes with *date* support, but also allow to run arbitrary *javascript* code within the templates. In fact, this note is created using [Templater]

## What's going on?
The following list contains an overview of all **zettels** that have been created within a timespan of  **3 days before and after** the creation of this **daily note**. 

```dataview
list
from "Zettle"
where file.ctime >= date(2021-07-09) and file.ctime <= date(2021-07-15) 
```
